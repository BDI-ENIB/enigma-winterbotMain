# winterbotMain
main code for ENIgma's winterbot

The repository is meant to be used as the main repository for the code on the winterbot
The pinout is included here.

Please note that the makefile has special options in order to make GPIO's works,
so the code will only compile on a raspberry with wiringPi properly installed (wich is
preinstalled on rasbian btw). 

For now the code is a simple blink programm
